* This is just examples of struggles I'm having with jest and typescript at the moment.
* If you call `yarn test reader.test.ts` it passes. I'm having trouble with `readerWithMockedRecord.test.ts`
* Record is a class that has a static method. I want to be able to mock the static method to return mocked instances of the class itself
